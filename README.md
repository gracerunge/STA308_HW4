# STA308_HW4

Purpose: To write a function called roulette_streaks 
  that randomly generates num_spins of roulette outcomes
  (corresponding to each of the colors with different 
  weighted probabilities) and determines the longest 
  streak of consecutive outcomes.
  
  I then determine the function is working by 
  simulating 1500 iterations of the process with a
  specific seed number. We will then provide summary 
  output and a histogram for this simulation and 
  comment on the distribution. 
  
  Lastly, we suppose a casino can do 1200 spins 
  per day (rather than the default 600) and run 
  the function for 1500 iterations to see how the 
  distribution changes.
